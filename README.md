# WORKSHOP: GENE-EXPRESSION ANALYSIS WITH RNA SEQUENCE DATA USING R

Files contain here are the data and scripts for RNA-seq analysis workshop in BioinforSummer 4 Dec 2019

*Presented by Dr Atefeh Taherian Fard and Huiwen Zheng, Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University Of Queensland*

In this workshop, you will learn how to analyse and explore RNA-seq count data. This hands-on workshop will cover basic steps in gene expression data analysis, including quality assessment, normalisation, differential gene expression testing, pathway over-representation analysis and visualisation. By the end of this workshop, you will be able to utilise the analysis workflow for your own RNA-seq data

Keywords: R, RStudio, RNA-seq, differential expression, data visualisation, DESeq2 and pathway analysis

Requirements: Participants must bring their own laptop and make sure that it has the latest version of R and RStudio installed. Experience in using R and RStudio is desired but not required.

Relevance: This workshop is relevant to anyone who is interested in learning how to present RNA-seq data in an informative and engaging way, or applying different statistical methods, to understand the data and interpret the result using R.
